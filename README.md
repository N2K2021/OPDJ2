# Optimizing Divine Journey 2

First of all we just need to remove some mods and change them with better / optimized forks.

Mods we should delete

- Spark
- Vanillafix
- Just Enough Items ( JEI )

Mods we should add instead

- Had Enough Items / https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/had-enough-items
- LessLag ( Disabling animations of blocks ) / https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/less-lag
- Multithreaded Noise / https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multithreaded-noise
- Spark Unforged / https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spark-unforged
- BlahajASM / https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blahajasm

NOTE: Optifine is not recommended with these mods but you can try at your own risk.
